# TwitterStockSentiment
- This project utilizies AlphaVantage's student API to obtain real time stock market data while also scraping Twitter and TradingView for tweets mentioning tickers
to aggregate sentiment values using Natural Language Processing. 

- It's heavily reliant on a package called snscrape, which allows the program to scrape twitter for a desired stock ticker. 

- I completed part of this project for my Unstructured Data class as part of my Masters degree, and continued to build out features following graduation. 
  This is some of my best code: it is clean, it is well documented, it involves aggregating data from a multitude of messy sources while also leveraging the power
  of Natural Language Processing to gain insights about specific stock's and what people are saying about them.
